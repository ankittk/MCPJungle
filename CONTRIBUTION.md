# Contribution Guidelines

## Development

### Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all contributors. Please be respectful and inclusive in all interactions.

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/MCPJungle.git
   cd MCPJungle
   ```
3. **Add the upstream repository** as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/mcpjungle/MCPJungle.git
   ```
4. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Development Environment Setup

See the [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) file for detailed setup instructions.

### Making Changes

#### Coding Standards

- **Go Code**:
  - Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
  - Use `gofmt` to format your code
  - Run `go vet` before submitting your changes
  - Ensure all tests pass with `go test ./...`
  - Add tests for new functionality


### Before Making Significant Changes

**If you plan on opening a PR for a significant change, first open a Discussion to align with the community on the changes you plan on making.** This helps ensure your effort is well-directed and aligns with project priorities.

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork** with the latest changes from upstream:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Push your changes** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** from your fork to the main repository.

4. **Write a good commit description** with all required information.

5. **Address review comments** if requested by maintainers.

6. **Update your PR** if needed:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "address review comments"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR.

### Documentation

- Update documentation for any changes to APIs, CLIs, or user-facing features
- Add examples for new features
- Update the README if necessary
- Add comments to your code explaining complex logic

### Dependency Management

- We rely on `go.mod` + `go.sum` as the single source of truth for dependencies
- The `vendor/` directory is not committed to reduce repo size
- For offline builds, use `go mod vendor` locally but don't commit the changes
- CI/Docker builds use module-aware mode with Go proxy

### Releasing

Only project maintainers can create releases. The process is:

1. Update version numbers in relevant files
2. Create a release branch
3. Create a tag for the release
4. Build and publish artifacts using goreleaser
5. Create a GitHub release with release notes

### Community

- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/CapV4Z3krk) for discussions
- Help answer questions in GitHub issues
- Review pull requests from other contributors
- Participate in GitHub Discussions for proposals and questions
