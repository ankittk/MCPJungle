## Contributing ðŸ’»

This document contains notes for Developers and Contributors of MCPJungle.

If you're simply a user of MCPJungle, you can skip this doc.

We're thrilled to have you here ðŸš€

If you'd like to contribute to the MCPJungle Codebase/Documentation, the following approach is suggested:

1. Learn the basic usage of mcpjungle. Go through the README & play around with the tool. Launch and use MCP servers.
2. Skim through the codebase to get a general idea - [CLI](https://github.com/mcpjungle/MCPJungle/tree/main/cmd), [HTTP API](https://github.com/mcpjungle/MCPJungle/blob/main/internal/api/server.go), [MCP Proxy server](https://github.com/mcpjungle/MCPJungle/blob/main/internal/service/mcp/proxy.go) (or ask Copilot to explain the architecture to you ;) )
3. Pick up an [issue](https://github.com/mcpjungle/MCPJungle/issues) that you like. Some of them are marked as `good first issue` but in general, pick whatever you like. Feel free to discuss it with the maintainers either on the issue thread or in [Discord](https://discord.gg/TSrUCTw9).
4. Feel free to open up Discussions if you want to propose something new.
5. When in doubt, just shoot a message in the Discord general chat and the maintainers will be there to help you out!

### Build for local testing
```bash
# Single binary for your current system
$ goreleaser build --single-target --clean --snapshot

# Test the full release assets (binaries, docker image) without publishing
goreleaser release --clean --snapshot --skip publish

# Binaries for all supported platforms
$ goreleaser release --snapshot --clean
```

### Dependency management policy
- We rely on `go.mod` + `go.sum` as the single source of truth for dependencies.
- The `vendor/` directory is not committed to the repository to reduce repo size and PR noise.
- For fully offline or air-gapped builds, regenerate vendors locally with `go mod vendor` if needed, but do not commit the changes.
- CI/Docker builds must use module-aware mode and fetch dependencies via the Go proxy. If necessary, set `GOPROXY="https://proxy.golang.org,direct"`.

### Create a new release
1. Create a Git Tag with the new version

```bash
git tag -a 0.1.0 -m "Release version 0.1.0"
git push origin 0.1.0
```

2. Release
```bash
# Make sure GPG is present on your system and you have a default key which is added to Github.

# set your github access token
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<your GH token>"

goreleaser release --clean
```

This will create a new release under Releases and also make it available via Homebrew.


### Use SQLite
When running MCPJungle with SQLite, you can access the database using the `sqlite3` command line tool.

```bash
sqlite3 mcp.db

> .tables
> SELECT * FROM mcp_servers;
> SELECT * FROM tools;

# and so on...
```

### Use PostgreSQL
When running MCPJungle with docker-compose, you can access the PostgreSQL database using the `pgadmin` utility.

Open `http://localhost:5050` in your browser and log in with the Username `admin@admin.com` and Password `admin`.

Add a new DB Server with the following settings:
- Host: `db`
- Port: `5432`
- Username: `mcpjungle`
- Password: `mcpjungle`
- Database: `mcpjungle`

Then you can open up tables and run queries.

### Use MCP Inspector
MCP Inspector is a GUI MCP client to test out all interactions with MCP servers.

Very useful for debugging and testing mcpjungle.

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```
